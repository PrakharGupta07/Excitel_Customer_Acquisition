- **City 1**: Enhance the lead qualification process and leverage operational efficiency in installations.
- **City 2**: Revise marketing and lead management strategies to improve conversion rates.
- **City 3**: Focus on improving late-stage strategies and streamline operations to reduce installation times.

### Cross-City Strategy
- **Standardization**: Implement best practices from City 1's early-stage strategies and fast installation times across other cities.

### Next Steps
- **Process Improvement**: Invest in analytics tools for better tracking and dynamic adjustments.
- **Resource Optimization**: Analyze resource utilization to optimize allocations and replicate successful strategies across all cities.
